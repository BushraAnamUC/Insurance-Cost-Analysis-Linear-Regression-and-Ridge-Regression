## Objectives

1. **Load the data as a pandas DataFrame**

   - Understand the dataset's structure by loading it using pandas.
   - Inspect the columns, datatypes, and sample data.

2. **Clean the data**

   - Handle blank entries and missing data.
   - Identify and manage outliers or incorrect values.
   - Normalize or encode categorical data if necessary.

3. **Run Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Visualize data distributions for key features.
   - Use correlation heatmaps to identify attributes affecting charges.
   - Summarize key statistics and patterns.

4. **Develop Linear Regression Models**

   - Create and evaluate single-variable linear regression models.
   - Develop multi-variable linear regression models.
   - Compare model performances.

5. **Refine Models Using Ridge Regression**

   - Implement ridge regression to handle multicollinearity and improve generalization.
   - Evaluate and compare ridge regression performance with linear regression.

## Instructions

### 1. Load the Data

- Use Python's pandas library to load the dataset as a DataFrame.
- Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and content. Ensure the data types are appropriate for analysis.

### 2. Clean the Data

- Check for missing or blank entries and handle them by either filling or removing them as per the data's requirements.
- Remove duplicate entries to avoid redundancy.
- Standardize or encode categorical variables to make them suitable for modeling.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explore the dataset visually using plots like histograms and boxplots to understand the distributions and identify any anomalies.
- Compute correlations to determine the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Summarize the key findings from the analysis to inform the modeling process.

### 4. Develop Linear Regression Models

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Develop single-variable linear regression models to assess the impact of individual features.
- Build multi-variable linear regression models for better predictions by using multiple relevant features.
- Measure the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.

### 5. Refine Models Using Ridge Regression

- Apply ridge regression to address multicollinearity and improve model robustness.
- Use appropriate regularization parameters to balance the trade-off between bias and variance.
- Compare the performance of ridge regression with the initial linear regression models to assess improvements.
